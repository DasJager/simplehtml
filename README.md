# API Switcher Chat Interface

A simple web-based chat interface that allows users to switch between the OpenAI ChatGPT API and Hugging Face API. The chat interface dynamically selects the desired API and displays the responses to user inputs in real-time.

## Features

- **API Switching**: Users can choose to interact with either OpenAI's ChatGPT or Hugging Face's models.
- **Asynchronous Requests**: Each request is handled asynchronously, displaying messages after API responses are received.
- **Error Handling**: Includes retry logic for rate limits (429 errors) and general error handling for failed requests.
- **Client-Side Implementation**: This is a fully client-side HTML/CSS/JavaScript solution.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the chat interface.
- **JavaScript**: Logic to handle user input, API requests, and dynamic message display.
